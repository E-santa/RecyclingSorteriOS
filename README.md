# Recycling Sorter
This is an iOS/iPadOS app to help people in Sunnyvale, California and Santa Clara, California sort waste correctly.

It is part of the Recycling Sorter Station, a recycling station built for the Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE) School to aid the growth of neurodivergent children.
## Motivation
Due to recycling contamination, Sunnyvale, like many other cities, loses millions of dollars annually, offsettable by selling more recycled material. The most efficient way to combat this problem is sorting waste at its source, achievable only through public awareness and education.

This app, combined with the station, teaches neurodivergent children to sort recycling properly, improving their independence, providing them a sense of achievement that they’re living productively and helping the environment, and reducing recycling contamination as these children will propagate proper sorting throughout society. This app, in combination with the station, also improves children’s motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and cognitive skills.

Moreover, this app helps the elderly, vision-impaired, and general public sort recycling more correctly.
